**Aim and Scope**

Optimization problems are ubiquitous in the real-world, including science, engineering, and technology. Despite a proliferation of studies on optimization, most existing optimization methods rely on a traditional centralized mode. Recently, the growing storage and computational power of edge devices of modern distributed networks have motivated the development of decentralized computing, such as federated optimization. The use of a wealth of data collected by edge devices raises the concern of privacy leakage and security threats, posing challenges to traditional centralized optimization methods. In addition, in some scenarios, users care about not only the optimization performance, but also fairness in decision-making, multi-objective preference, or model construction. Therefore, the development of new algorithmic ideas and theories in optimization paradigm is crucial.

Driven by the aforementioned scenarios, developing secure, privacy-preserving, and fairness-aware optimization techniques has attracted increasing attention most recently. Related research topics include security and robustness, privacy-preservation, fairness, verifiability, and transparency in designing optimization algorithms and many questions remain open. First of all, it is worth discussing the definitions of security, privacy, and fairness in the context of optimization, as many of these concepts remain elusive. Second, a key challenge is to achieve an appropriate balance between the optimization performance and privacy/security/fairness guarantees. Third, longstanding questions in distributed and federated machine learning must be revisited in the context of optimization, such as non-IID data and communication efficiency. Last but not the least, it is desired to design new test benchmark problems and performance indicators for the evaluation of secure, privacy-preserving, and fairness-aware optimization methods.

The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers from different application fields working on optimization and present new solutions to the above-discussed challenges. The special session will focus on new advances, review and discuss the state-of-the-art in the theory, algorithm design, and applications of using secure, privacy-preserving, and fairness-aware solutions in optimization.
